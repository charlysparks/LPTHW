Learn Python the Hard Way

As many have done before me and many will do after me. I am embarking on completing the classic Zed Shaw books. Python was the first ever programming language that I had used. My only regret in life was never committing to Python with my whole heart. This is one of the first steps to change it all.

REMINDER TO SELF: Figure out if there is a default setting for Py3 on your secondary drive so that you do not have to run every file as "py -3" because it defaults to 2.7.
